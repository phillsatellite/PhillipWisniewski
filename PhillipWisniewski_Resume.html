            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm a QA Engineer who's all about details, organization, and delivering quality. I've worked with amazing teams from around the world, 
                solving problems and ensuring things run smoothly. I keep projects on track by creating thorough test cases and maintaining an organized backlog 
                ensuring issues are being resolved in a timely manner.  </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>QA Engineer</strong> - Satellite.im (June 2021 - Present)
                    <p>In this role, I've worked with co-workers all around the globe testing a peer to peer chat app built in Web3, Java, Rust, and Flutter environments 
                        across Android, iOS, MacOS, Windows, and Linux ensuring that the product meets the highest standard possible across all of these platforms. 
                        I've used Jira, Github, XCode, and AndroidStudio to track bugs, document test cases, test and review pull requests, and collaborate effectively with developers 
                        and stakeholders to ensure the deadlines are being met. I've also been able to start learning Cypress Automation to better track bugs as well. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Shift Lead</strong> - Wawa (August 2015 - June 2021)
                    <p>As a shift lead at Wawa I was in charge of day to day operations. I would assign my team members to their stations for the day and plan out the break schedule. 
                        Followed by that I would do a code check ensuring the product had not exceeded its expiration date. During the afternoon I would assist with completing the order 
                        for the truck ensuring any product we are low on we restocked. When both the main order (included food for deli and shelf stock) and the dairy order 
                        (milk and other drinks for the coldbox) I would unload and organize them accordingly making sure the newest product is in the back. I would also assist at other 
                        stations throughout the day as needed. This job required strong organizational skills, attention to detail, and the ability to lead by example.</p>
